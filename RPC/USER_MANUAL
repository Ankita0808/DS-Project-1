Steps to run and test:
1.	./make (Makefile already include make clean)
2.	./portmapper
3.	./server (can run multiple servers to test load balancing)
4.	./client (can run multiple clients simultaneously, already has simple gui)

There are some parameters to change and test in header.h, one of them is:
#define TEST_UDP_LOST_PACKET_NUMBER 0 // percentage of UDP packet loss for test; default is 0
(This is for testing UDP packet lost. In short, instead of sending all packets, the sender will not send a number of packets based on the define percentage)

For other parameters changes, please read the comment next to it.
